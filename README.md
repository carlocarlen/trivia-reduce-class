# Practicing the Ugly Trivia Game Kata - Mastering Large-Class Refactoring

This repository contains some practices on the [Ugly Trivia Game Kata](https://kata-log.rocks/ugly-trivia-kata), the Java version.

Practices in this repository focus on the challenge of breaking down a large class.

This repository is the supporting material for this series of articles focusing 
on the challenge of breaking down a large class:
* one (TODO)
* two (TODO)
* three (TODO)

The _master_ branch contains the starting point for all practices.
It implements a Golden Master Test (not present in the original kata), 
to guarantee the accuracy of the refactoring steps.
